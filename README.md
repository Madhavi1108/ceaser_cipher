The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. It's named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it to communicate with his generals.

How the Caesar Cipher works:
Shifting: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.
Wrap Around: If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, it wraps around. For example, with a shift of 3, "Z" becomes "C".
Same Case: The cipher maintains the case of each letter (uppercase or lowercase).
Non-alphabetic characters: Spaces, numbers, and punctuation are not changed by the cipher.
